   <title>Better mother fucking website.</title> 
 </head>
          
    <h1>This is still a motherfucking website.</h1>
   <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
   <h1>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h1>
   <b>7 fucking declarations.</b>
   <p>7 That's how much CSS it 
       took to turn that <font color="800080"><u class = "souligné" >grotesque pile of shit </u> </font>  into <br> this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so 
       fucking simple and it still has all <br> the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
   <li>Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
   <li>Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
   <li>Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
   <li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
   <li>Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
   <h2>And guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
   <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. <br> Here's how</p>
   <h1>A little less contrast</h1>
   <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real <br> life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. 
       I would've even made this site's <br> background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping <br> declarations 
       to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
   <h1>Size Matters</h1>
   <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body <br> copy to render close to 16px or more. 
    Smaller type works well for <br> print, not the screen.</p> 
   <h1>Line-width, motherfucker</h1>
   <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a <br> line of text that's 200 fucking characters long.
        Keep it to a nice 60-80 <br> and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
   <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
<p>I love what the creator of <font color="800080" > <u class="souligné2"> this site's inspiration </u> </font> did. 
    What I'm saying <br> is that it's so, so simple to make 
    sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are <br> functional, high-performing, and accessible, but 
    they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web <br> designers out there need to make them not total shit. <br>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>
<p>Inspired by the geniuses 
    behind <font color="800080"><u class = "souligné3" >motherfuckingwebsite.com </u> </font>
    and <font color = "0000ff">  <u>texti</u> </font>. <br> <br>
    This page—that isn't a total fucking eyesore—was created by <font color = "0000ff" > <u class= "souligné5">me</u>  </font>
        with <br> help 
    from <font color="0000ff" ><u class= "souligné6">him</u>. </font> </p>
